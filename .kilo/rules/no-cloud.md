## No cloud uploads in this fork (rules for every AI agent and contributor)

This fork sends nothing to any cloud. These rules apply to every AI coding agent
(Kilo Code, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo, Gemini,
Codex, Kiro, Aider or any other) and every contributor. The full policy, with
examples and an upstream-merge checklist, is in `docs/no-cloud-policy.md`: read
it before touching `src/cloud/`, `src/telemetry/`, `src/mcp/brains.ts`, or code
that uploads, syncs, pairs, connects or logs in to a remote service.

1. **Anything that sends data to a cloud is disabled by default.** This covers
   Trail cloud and workspace sync, telemetry (PostHog), and any future upload,
   sync, share, pairing, remote logging or "connect your account" feature. When
   you add such code, or integrate it from upstream (`NanoNets/Graft`) by
   merge, rebase, cherry-pick or copy, its gate must answer "off" with no
   configuration, like `cloudEnabled()` in `src/cloud/workspace.ts` and
   `offReason()` in `src/telemetry/gate.ts`. Do not add a switch that turns it
   back on unless the user asks for one, never re-enable a gate that is off
   here even if upstream changed it, and say in your reply what you disabled.
2. **Tests of such features are skipped.** A test file that needs data sent to
   a cloud, or a (fake) cloud server to answer, gets this line at the top:
   `// @cloud-sending-test: needs data sent to a cloud, which this fork disables. Skipped by scripts/run-tests.mjs unless CLOUD_TESTS=1.`
   `npm test` skips every file carrying `@cloud-sending-test`. Do not tag
   tests that check that sending stays off (`test/trail-cloud.test.ts`,
   `test/telemetry-gate.test.ts`), and never make a test pass by turning a
   feature back on.

Fetching public data in, at the user's request and carrying nothing about the
user, machine or repo (`graft prices update`, the npm version check, LLM calls
to the endpoint the user configured), is not covered. When unsure whether
something sends data out, treat it as covered and ask the user.
